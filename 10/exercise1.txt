// Peter Koll, Jonas Wagner

flat profile:
tells which methods we used and how much time they took

call graph:
tells how much a parent methods calls child methods

we can now optimize the code with parallelization, because we know how much time
a method needs to be executed and how many times each function is called.
parallelization can be done by parallel function call or parallizing the 
methods themselves.
