Exercise 2
I)
for the first implementation the function f should be 8x * (n / (s/32))
= 8x*(32n/s).
8x: 8 sets while every matrix A and B gets 4 sets each, but we need to access
    every matrix which leads to 4*2 = 8. x is the number of lines.
n:  length of a line of a matrix
s/32: length of a line within the cache divided by the size of an element
        within the matrix. so this describes the number of elements which can
        be stored in a cache line.
we have a cache miss per line.
        
II)
we multiply the matrices by columns which leads to a cache miss everytime we
want to access a line and a column. so the misses will be nÂ². the whole 
function needs to be multiplied by 2 because of the number of objects to be
multiplied (A, B).
