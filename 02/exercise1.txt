Exercise 1
a)
with one processor: O(n³ + n)
with p processors: O(n³/p + n)
when we use one processor the time complexity will stay n³+n.
with every added processor n³/(2, 3, ... ) we will speedup the algorithm.
if we would like to plot a graph of this complexity it will be 1/log(p).

b)
speedup up = O(n^(2.8) / O(n^3/p + n)
when we just use a few processors, the parallel algorithm is slower than the
sequential algorithm. At a certain point, the parrallel algorithm gets faster
than the sequential one as described in c)


c) 
we set n^(2.8) = (n³/p) + n
this leads to p = n²/(n^(1.8)-1)
so if at this point the two graphs intersect. if we add 1 processor (p+1)
the parallel algorithm will be faster.
